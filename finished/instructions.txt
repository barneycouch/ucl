Run the scaffsplitter program first to separate a lot of files into individual scaff-id files.
-You will need to run it in the form "python scaffsplitter.py shortncp" where the string is without quotes, and shortncp is replaced with any file you need to split

Then run the scr14.py script to produce a text file for each scaff record
-In the form "python scr14.py scaff1 10 5 2 1" where scaff1 is replaced with the file to analyse, and the other commands are <source file>  <window length>  <window increment> <decreasing window increment> <minimum window size>

You can automate this to run for multiple files with a bit of bash looping.
